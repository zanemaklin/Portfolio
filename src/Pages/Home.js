          <p>Hi I'm Zane! Thank you for visting my website. I am a mechanical engineering graduate from <a href="https://www.queensu.ca/">Queen's University</a> I'm always looking for a challenge and problem to solve. My curiosity and drive to explore the unconventional has gifted me with passions from Blacksmithing to Bike Polo. My friends would describe me as inquisitive and joyful with no problem too big to tackle. I function on understanding how things work and thrive on improving them. </p>
